		The <b>Master Control</b> page has basic playback controls. You can play, pause, stop and skip
ahead on the play list. If you want to test a playlist or change it for a party or special visitor, you
can select it in the <b>Playlist</b> drop down menu and click <b>Play Now</b>. There are also <b>All on</b> and <b>All
off</b> buttons. This will turn on or off all of the displays and computers.

		The <b>Scheduling</b> page allows you to schedule playlists via time and date. The playlist will
continue to loop from the time that it is scheduled until the next playlist is scheduled to play.
Once a daily schedule is set up, you can set it as the default schedule for the week or for the
whole month.

		Use the <b>Playlists</b> page to create and modify playlists. A playlist is made up of a series of clips.
Each clip is actually a pair; one plays on the video ribbon and the other on the concierge monitor.
On this page, you can make a playlist the default playlist (the one that plays when the system
turns on), edit the existing playlists, or create a new one.

		Create a new playlist by specifying the name and then adding clips from the drop down menu.
To insert a clip, click one of the existing clips in the playlist, select a clip in the dropdown menu,
and then press <b>Add</b>.

		The <b>Clips (Admin)</b> page lists the current clips and allows editing and adding new ones. It
should only be modified by a programmer who is familiar with the Delta system. The clips are
created in the CMS to give a more user-friendly name to the marker names in the Delta. In the
example above, the clip called <b>Photos 123 & Discover & Fishing</b> is made up of two Delta
markers. <b>M6_123</b> is the first photoset on the Ribbon and is 60 seconds long.
<b>DISCOVER_FISHING</b> are two 30-second spots that play on the concierge monitor while the
photos are on the ribbon. These Delta markers are hard coded into the Delta timeline system.

	<p class="man-text">
		When creating a new clip, enter the name of the clip as it will appear in the CMS, the video
ribbon marker name, and the concierge marker name. Again, only a programmer familiar with
the Delta system should make these changes.
